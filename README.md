Adds a species containing 68 popular characters from Kemono Friends the animation.<br>
All character sprites and the map logo have been imported from Japari Library Wiki.<br>
The species is added outside the regular categories, which means using it disables ironman achievements.<br>
Also includes a flag and a room background of Japari Park.
